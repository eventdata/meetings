# Working Group Essentials

<br />
 
Welcome to our working group! 

If you are new to this project, we strongly encourage you to familiarize yourself with the basic content of this page. This will help you to jump right into the conversations we are having during our weekly meetings. Gaining familiarity with the history of this project will avoid confusions and waste of time (for you and the rest of the team).

This is the project's [main website](https://eventdata.utdallas.edu/)

## ConfliBERT basic developments

Please read the papers presenting the ConfliBERT family models. Pay particular attention at the source and volume of corpus used for pre-training. Also, please identify the databases and specific tasks used in the downstream applications in each paper.

## Documenting your work

We have a big collaborative team that often involves several members working on the same project. 
Also, we often use data, results, or outputs of some papers as inputs for new papers. 
So, it is super important for you to **document everything that you do**.

In this project, we abide by the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), which stands for:
* **F**indability
* **A**ccessibility
* **I**nteroperability
* **R**euse of digital assets

The overall objective is that all your data, scripts, and results should be easily accessible and replicable by anyone. 
Here *anyone* means any member of our team, but also any external user who may not have any idea about the project or even advanced computer science skills. 
So, please make sure you structure your work flow, organize your data, write your scripts, and specific routines and commands in a way that anyone can follow your work.

Here are a few basic guidelines to keep in mind:

1. **Your data and scripts are not yours** Yes, you are the one doing all the work, but all the data and script should be tailored to a general public audience. 
2. **Document everything**  Please use headers and subheaders in your scripts to organize your work. Please make excessive use of comments to describe procedures and steps in your code. Ideally, you should document this for each single command. This takes a concious documentation effort in structuring and conducting your work at every step. It will be hard at the beginning, but eventually it should flow naturally.
3. **Use prefixes for sequential steps** Try to use numeric prefixes in your folder and file names (e.g. `1_filename`) to indicate steps or scripts that should be run in sequential order.
4. **Use sufixes for version control** Always use numeric sufixes for version control (e.g. `1_filename_v1`). You can create an `old` folder to keep previous versions of your code.
5. **Ensure replicability** Make sure anyone can run your entire code to replicate all your results without your supervision. Your folders, scripts, and data should be self-explanatory. Avoid the "well, it runs in my computer" excuse.
